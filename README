groovePwn by Jonathan Heathcote, GPLv3

--- FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY ---

A minimal proxy which will remove ads and snatch MP3s from Grooveshark and store
them in an organised manner while you use the site as-per-usual.

To run:
1: From your chosen download directory run
   python proxy.py
2: Instruct your web browser to use localhost port 8080 as a proxy
3: Use grooveshark as per usual and observe the MP3s being placed nicely into
   your current directory!


Obviously I condone the use of this software and it is naturally not intended
for any use beyond education study. I highly recommend you don't use it.
